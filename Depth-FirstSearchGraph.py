"""
Using BFS or DFS can make a difference according to the way in which you
need to traverse a graph. 
From a programming point of view, the difference between the two algorithms is how each one stores the vertexes to explore the
following:
» A queue for BFS, a list that works according to the FIFO principle. Newly
discovered vertexes don’t wait long for processing.
» A stack for DFS, a list that works according to the last in/first out (LIFO)
principle.
