Determining which application to use(Breadth First Search or Depth First Search)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I) The choice between BFS and DFS depends on how you plan to apply the output
from the search. 
Developers often employ BFS to locate the shortest route between two points as quickly as possible. 
This means that you commonly find BFS used in applications such as GPS, where finding the shortest route is paramount. 
You can see BFS used for spanning tree, shortest path, and many other minimization algorithms in differnet books, code example.

II) A DFS focuses on finding an entire path before exploring any other path. 
You use it when you need to search in detail, rather than generally. 
For this reason, you often see DFS used in games, where finding a complete path is important. 
It’s also an optimal approach to perform tasks such as finding a solution to a maze.

III) Sometimes you have to decide between BFS and DFS based on the limitations of each technique. 
BFS needs lots of memory because it systematically stores all the paths before finding a solution. 
On the other hand, DFS needs less memory, but you have no guarantee that it’ll find the shortest and most direct solution.
